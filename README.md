### 1. Concept

This was a project during an online course by Jonas Schmedtmann. The concept was to build a game where the player guesses a number to match a secret random number between 1 and 20. This was accomplished using no frameworks and working with only JavaScrpt, HTML, and CSS.



### 2. Initial Planning

The planning for this project was accomplished by designing the layout of the game and then working on functionality.

### 3. Obstacles

As always creating more features on a tutorial is difficult. I decided to start with a basic change of theme by adding a button which can change the background color of the game between black and red. 

### 4. Future Additions

* More themes
* Two player mode
* Difficulty levels
